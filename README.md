## Description 

This repo contains the code to an app that will hopefully see the day of light one day. The app itself will serve as the website for [Vespera Design Studio](https://www.instagram.com/vespera_design_studio/) where users can fill out a form and thus select designs for their backyards. In other words, the app will serve as a tool where clients can submit their requirements, desires and ideas, and then it will be up to landscapers/ designers to incorporate clients' wishes into a finished product. This will not only make it easier for clients to select design packages but also for designers who can begin implementing the design more quickly.
